                    <p className="bio-text">Hello World! My name is José María Centurión. I am currently enrolled in the MERN Full Stack Bootcamp at the University of Pennsylvania, powered by Trilogy. I am an aspiring junior web developer with a particular talent and focus in front-end development. I am extremely passionate about UI/UX design and mobile responsiveness, and I can promise you that I obsess over every detail! Born in Asunción, Paraguay, I grew up in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and attended the Philadelphia High School for Creative and Performing Arts. After obtaining a B.S. in Exercise Science from Temple University, I worked in the fields of golf instruction and sports therapy up until the pandemic made me consider a change in career paths. Over the past six months I've gone from being afraid of deleting divs to implementing my graphic design education into finished front-end products; gaining a reputation within my cohort for front-end design. I hope to one day provide a company with my expertise and vision and, in turn, bring their clientele products that capture their customer's attention while providing them with greater accessibility, and in turn producing more enjoyable interactions with the interface.</p>
